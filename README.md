Social media refers to websites and applications that are designed to allow people to share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. Many people define social media as apps on their smartphone or tablet.
The ability to share photos, opinions, events, etc in real-time has transformed the way we live and, also, the way we do business.
Based on the existing social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) create your own social media to connect people and businesses.
#### Your website should do the following:
    1. Have a login system that allow a user to login or register (login will only be granted if the user credential were found in the database)
    2. On the register form get the user basic details and store them in the database.
    3. Allow user to login in the system based on their email and password Note:( Email should be unique, if the user is already registered in the database provide option such as login or forget password to allow him to login)
    4. Once logged in create a user timeline where the user can share post, share picture.
    5. The user should also have a profile page (profile pictures, account holder name, etc)
    6. Provide an option for the user to see another user profile (profile picture, timelineâ€¦.)
    7. Finally allow the user to send a message to another user who is using your social media (Allow them to send messages to each other hint: user a search button to search for a particular user)
    8. Using your personal discretion make the social media beautiful by enhancing it with CSS3, Javascript or JQuery.
#### NOTE: THE USE OF TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS BOOTSTRAP AND WORDPRESS FOR DESIGNING IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!!!
